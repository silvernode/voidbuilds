# voidbuilds build scripts

This repository will not work on it's own and requires https://github.com/void-linux/void-mklive .
Additionally these scripts require a key that signs the sha256sums.txt file which is generated each night. You will need to create your own key to sign the file on your own machine. The key is called by the sign-file.sh script.
